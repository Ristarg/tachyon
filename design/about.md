# About Tachyon

Tachyon is an experimental programming language, developed initially in Rust. The purpose of this project is to 
explore various existing language design choices, and understand the underlying structure of modern programming 
languages. It is not intended to be a tool to be used in production or as a hobby, although it may develop into 
one the future.
