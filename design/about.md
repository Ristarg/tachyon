# About Tachyon

Tachyon is an experimental programming language, developed initially in Rust. The purpose of this project is to 
explore various existing language design choices, and understand the underlying structure of modern programming 
languages. It is not intended to be a tool to be used in production or as a hobby, although it may develop into 
one the future.

# Stuff to do (in no particular order)
- [x] Test are broken, fix them and move out to a separate file
- REFACTOR REFACTOR REFACTOR
- Would be nice to have some negative numbers, also subtraction
- Floats? Also division
- Powerrrr!! Actually, probably best to make it a function
- So need to be able to make functions
- So need to be able to make variables
- Isn't really worth it right now, but at some point will have to do file loading. Think of a good file extension!
- Runtime shouldn't shit itself completely on malformed input
- Lists? and other arbitrary-length expressions
- Compile to a simple stack VM for fun?
- Compile to x86_64? (god have mercy)
